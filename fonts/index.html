                        <br>Ashtadukht is a star-reckoner. The worst there's ever been.
                        <br>Witness her treacherous journey through Iranian legends and ancient history.

                     <p><br>Only a brave few storytellers still relate cautionary glimpses into the life of Ashtadukht, a woman who commanded the might of the constellations—if only just, and often unpredictably. They’ll stir the imagination with tales of her path to retribution.
                     How, fraught with bereavement and a dogged illness, she criss-crossed Sassanian Iran in pursuit of creatures now believed mythical. Then, in hushed tones, what she wrought on that path. | <b><a href="http://www.astarreckonerslot.com/ASRL_excerpt.pdf" target="_blank">Read the first three chapters here.</a></b>
                     
                        <p><blockquote>I'm afraid I'll overuse the word imaginative if I tried to describe what Drake has done here in the depth I want to. You haven't read a fantasy novel like this one before &mdash; almost certainly, anyway &mdash; but you should.

<p><blockquote>[ On Ashtadukht, the protagonist. ] I found her to be one of the more realistic female characters I've read about in a long time. She, along with the detail is what really made this book worth reading the most.<cite> - <a href="http://archeddoorway.com/2017/01/10/7070/" target="_blank">The Arched Doorway</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote>It would be easy to read A Star-Reckoner's Lot as a simple adventure set in an unfamiliar mythos, but the themes of love and honour, exclusion and belonging, and regret for the prices paid for actions raises it above many fantasy novels. Do not be misled by the author's light hand (and occasional bad puns); this is a story with some haunting imagery and deep themes, and not one I'm going to forget quickly.

                     <p>The events of A Star-Reckoner's Lot unfold in a fictional setting heavily inspired by 6th-century Iran. At the time, the Sassanian Empire stretched from the Euphrates in the West to Central Asia in the East. Through a combination
                        of strength of arms and tolerance, Sassanian Iran brought swathes of land into its fold. There, by harnessing cultures and ideas from both within and without, the empire nurtured the arts and sciences. It glowed with an appreciation
                        for court, religion, king, and nature—often finding unity in depictions of the Royal Hunt.

                        <p>Many of the well-travelled tales of One Thousand and One Nights first graced the lips of storytellers in Sassanian Iran's thriving and magical folktales. The empire's military conquests scored heavy blows on many fronts: from the
                           Eastern Roman Empire to the Caucasus, from Arabia to Sogdiana, its armies commanded respect.

                           <p>A mighty yet often unsung player in ancient history, Sassanian Iran commanded an indelible place both in contemporary times, and in the world we live in today.

                     <h2>About the Author</h2>Darrell Drake has published four books, with A Star-Reckoner's Lot being the latest. He often finds himself inspired by his research to take on new hobbies. Birdwatching, archery, stargazing, and a heightened interest in history have
                     all become a welcome part of his life thanks to this habit.

                     <p><h2>The Editor</h2>

                     <p>Alice Leiper is a freelance proofreader whose experience includes business documentation, novels, short stories, essays and more. When she’s not working she’s catching up on the latest fantasy novels, writing stories of her own, or
                        crocheting blankets and scarves. She also boasts a bachelor's degree in Ancient History and Archaeology, and a master's in Classical Mediterranean, which will surely come in handy!
                        <h2>The Cover Artist</h2>
                        <p>Ruyi Yuen began her career in advertising, and was later a freelance designer and illustrator. She is currently a full-time mom, and moonlights as an illustrator and comic artist. Ruyi has worked with me on several projects now,
                           the most notable being the covers of my second novel, Everautumn, and A Star-Reckoner's Lot, of course.
